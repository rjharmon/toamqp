=== 0.1.1 / ???

* FIXED: Race condition on server/client creation

* All connects now go through the Connection class. This is the main class and
  the others don't really need to be exposed anymore.

* Tracking bunny version (now 0.6.0) - Queue#pop changed its semantics
  slightly.
  
* Now uses the headers argument for message routing. See oneway_spec for an
  example of this. 
  
  As a consequence, all queues generated are private (appending uuid to the
  exchange name) and messages will get forwarded to all servers that match
  the headers. This used to be a kind of round robin behavior.
  
* Service point abstraction over exchanges and queues. Hopefully, this should
  be more intuitive for users. 

=== 0.1.0 / 2009-08-27

* One-way communication with a thrift service, using a header exchange.
