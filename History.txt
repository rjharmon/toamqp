=== 0.3.1

  * Server now posts to the 'responses' exchange, as recommended by the SOA 
    over AMQP recipe. This allows removal of the uuid dependency and probably
    a 200% speedup in the future.

  * Releasing TOAMQP::SpecServer as well. This should help develop clean spec
    code when using toamqp.
  
  * FIX :pass / :password can now both be used
  
  * FIX Filtered queues now really work. A mixup with the queue names would
    result in messages being sent to the wrong receiver.
    
  * FIX: Threading issue with multiple connections

=== 0.3 / 2010-01-01

* Complete rewrite: Code is now much more structured and the specs reflect 
  intent better. 
  
* New API - more rails like, less configuration to remember. 

* SLOW: Tops at about 100 messages per second. This limitation can be much 
  improved upon by creating less connections and creating connections more 
  cleverly.

=== 0.2

* New API that allows clearly expressing intent.

* The oneway limitation falls: bidirectional communication becomes possible. 

=== 0.1.1

* Service point abstraction over exchanges and queues. 

* FIXED: Race condition on server/client creation

* All connects now go through the Connection class. This is the main class and
  the others don't really need to be exposed anymore.

* Tracking bunny version (now 0.6.0) - Queue#pop changed its semantics
  slightly.
  
* Now uses the headers argument for message routing. See oneway_spec for an
  example of this. 
  
  As a consequence, all queues generated are private (appending uuid to the
  exchange name) and messages will get forwarded to all servers that match
  the headers. This used to be a kind of round robin behavior.

=== 0.1.0 / 2009-08-27

* One-way communication with a thrift service, using a header exchange.
