h1. Thrift over AMQP (toamqp)

h2. DESCRIPTION

Transports "thrift":http://incubator.apache.org/thrift/ messages via an "AMQP broker":http://www.amqp.org.

Advantages: ("see also":http://www.openamq.org/doc:amqp-background)

* *Less Network Load* You don't open as many TCP connections (one instead of one per service)

* *Simplicity* One well known service point (your broker) instead of many IP/port pairs to know for clients

* *Persistence* Messages wont get lost if you don't want them to.

* *Safe IPC* Since the AMQP broker implements a queue, you can avoid doing so on your end. No mucking around with Threads and Queues.

This library provides the glue code between thrift and bunny (AMQP client) and allows easy creation of a service.

h2. SYNOPSIS

Using the following interface definition: 

<pre><code>
  service AwesomeService {
    // a little hommage 
    oneway void battleCry(1:string battlecry);
  }
</code></pre>
  
Create a connection to your AMQP server: 

<pre><code>
  # Default is localhost, user guest, password guest. 
  TOAMQP.connection_manager.connection_attributes = {
    :host => 'mq.mydomain.com
  }
</code></pre>

On the server (consumer of messages): 

<pre><code>
  class MyAwesomeService < TOAMQP::Service::Base
    exchange 'awesome_service'    # public name of the service
    serves AwesomeService         # Module generated by thrift
    
    def battleCry(message)
      puts messages
    end
  end
  
  TOAMQP.server(MyAwesomeService.new).serve--
</code></pre>

On the client: 

<pre><code>
  client = TOAMQP.client('awesome_service', AwesomeService)
  
  client.battleCry('chunky bacon!')   # prints 'chunky bacon!' on the server
</code></pre>

h2. INSTALLATION

A development machine needs a fairly recent AMQP broker (should implement the headers binding type) and the full thrift install. You need the full install  to be able to compile thrift service definitions.

To install this library, just type 

<pre><code>
  $ gem install toamqp
</code></pre>

h2. SPECIFICATION

To run the specs, just type

<pre><code>
  $ rake specs
</code></pre>
  
Integration tests need a AMQP broker to run on localhost. This has so far only been tested with RabbitMQ. (http://www.rabbitmq.com/)

<pre><code>
  $ rake thrift
  $ rake
</code></pre>
